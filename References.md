## Projects I am interested in:
* [Python for PSoC](https://github.com/EmbeditElectronics/Python_for_PSoC)
  * This was originally an RPI project that I bought on Kickstarter. I could possibly work on this but I still haven't received the hardware.
* [Pimusicbox](https://github.com/pimusicbox/pimusicbox)
  * This is a pretty cool project that I found to control Spotify and Airplay music control on the Raspberry Pi.
* [AWS CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli)
  * This is an Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface. When using AWS before it bugged me how I was deploying on a web interface so it would be cool to work on a project that solves a problem of mine.
* [Boto 3](https://github.com/boto/boto3)
  * The AWS Software development kit for python.
